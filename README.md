This is the images that you need to run realmscript on high quality.

To use this, download Kalle's realmscript, link here
https://github.com/kallerotmg/realmscript

Now, copy and paste the orginal images to a backup folder.
You do this just incase you ever want to go back to low quality images.

Next, drag and replace the img folder with the one I provided you.
Run realmscript and see if it works!

All realmscript credit goes to Kalle.
